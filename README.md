# Algorithms

These are the programming assignments
from [Coursera's Algorithms course](part1) ([Part I][part1]
and [Part II][part2]) taught by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne provided by
University of Princeton.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer
needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on
applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. 

- Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.
- Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
